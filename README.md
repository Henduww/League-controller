# League Controller
Adds XBOX One controller support for 'League of Legends'.
This software was created for no other use than to provide a different type of gameplay in the popular MOBA.

The software does not give the user any kind of advantage over the other players in the game. If anything, it puts the user at a dis-advantage.

**I highly recommend using locked camera while using this software**

### This software is still in BETA
The program is still in beta, therefore, it lacks certain features that I am planning on implementing.
Some bugs may also occur, but after having used this myself, since 2.3 I haven't experienced any unexpected behaviour yet.

# Who is this for?
My goal when creating this program was to make an efficient program with high performance.

The program should run on any kind of Windows computer and supports both XBOX One and XBOX 360 controllers.
**(An XINPUT emulator for PS4 controllers may work, as well.)**

If you want a different type of relaxed gameplay for LOL, this should be on your bucket list. Installation is easy and starting the program takes a couple of seconds, requiring you to input 2 things.

# How do I use this program?
To install the program, simply download the current versions `.rar` file, open it and run `LeagueController.exe`

After launch, the program will require you to input your sensitivity. Float values (such as 2.45) are allowed. (Default is 1. Inputting a character rather than a number will cause the program to use default sensitivity.)
After setting your sensitivity, you may invert the triggers and shoulder buttons (LB/RB).
> See Keybinds.txt for more information regarding inverting

*Inputting anything other than 'yes' will keep the default settings.*

# How do I contribute?
If you wish to contribute on the project, I could have use for:
 - A QT Graphical user interface
 - Implementation assistance
 - Fixes/improvements

If you feel you can help with any of the above, feel free to contact me on Discord @ Chaost#9871

## Other notable information
This program is tested on a variety of computers, and works as supposed on every tested device.
CPU usage should be around < 5% during initialization, and should stay at 0% - 1% CPU usage after initialization is finished and controller is being used.
Memory usage is around ~5MB.

## Upcoming changes/features
I'm planning on improving and expanding upon this project. Suggestions are also welcome.
Here are some planned changes coming in the future:
 - Customizable keybinds
 - Camera movement with RS
 - Friendlier user interface (graphical intead of command-line)
